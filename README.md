## RBD_actigraphy
This is an analysis that evaluates motor activities during sleep.  
This analysis do not evaluate motor activities in epoch units, but quantify them as a continuous block.  
You can visualize motor activity block (MAB) on the raw accelerometer data and get 4 evaluation indices that provides characteristics of motor activity during sleep.  

You can get the daily and total reports in the results
